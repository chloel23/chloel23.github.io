<p>|c  g  am  f|


[verse 1]
c
we were both young when i first saw you
f
i close my eyes, and the flashback starts
             am                    f
i'm standing there on a balcony in summer air
c     
see the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
c
see you make your way through the crowd
          am
and say, "hello"
           g
little did I know


[pre-chorus]
     f                        g
that you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
       am                          c
and my daddy said, "stay away from juliet"
          f
and i was crying on the staircase
g                           am   f     g
begging you, "please, don't go," and i said


[chorus]
c
romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
g
i'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
am
you'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
f                  g              c
it's a love story, baby, just say "yes"


[verse 2]
c
so I sneak out to the garden to see you
f
we keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
              am
so close your eyes
                       g
escape this town for a little while, oh, oh


[pre-chorus]
       f                       g
'cause you were romeo, i was a scarlet letter
       am                          c
and my daddy said, "stay away from juliet"
             f
but you were everything to me
g                                 am   f   g
i was begging you, "please, don't go," and i said


[chorus]
c
romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
g
i'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
am
you'll be the prince and i'll be the princess
f
it's a love story, baby, just say "yes"
c
romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
g
this love is difficult, but it's real
am
don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
f                  g
it's a love story, baby, just say yes

               am      f            c                    g
i got tired of waiting wondering if you were ever coming around
                 am f
my faith in you was fading
       c                           g
when i met you on the outskirts of town


[chorus]
c
and i said, "romeo, save me, i've been feeling so alone
g
i keep waiting for you but you never come
am
is this in my head? i don't know what to think
   f                       g
he knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
d
marry me, juliet, you'll never have to be alone
a
i love you, and that's all I really know
bm
i talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
g                  a               d
