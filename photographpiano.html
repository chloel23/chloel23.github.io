[intro]
|e  c#m  b  a|

[verse]
           e
loving can hurt 
           c#m
loving can hurt sometimes
             b                    a
but it's the only thing that I know
             e
when it gets hard
                    c#m
you know it can get hard sometimes
          b                            a
it is the only thing makes us feel alive

[pre-chorus]
c#m                     a
we keep this love in a photograph
e                       b
we made these memories for ourselves
           c#m
where our eyes are never closing
     a
our hearts are never broken
     e                         b
and time's forever frozen, still

[chorus]
           e 
so you can keep me inside the pocket of your 
b
ripped jeans holding me closer 'til our 
c#m                             a
eyes meet, you won't ever be alone
                       e
wait for me to come home

[verse 2]
            e
loving can heal
           c#m
loving can mend your soul
             b                       a
and it's the only thing that i know
                    e
i swear it will get easier
                           c#m
remember that with every piece of ya
            b                                   a
it's the only thing we take with us when we die

[pre-chorus]
c#m					    a
we keep this love in a photograph

		  c#m
where our eyes are never closing
	 a
our hearts were never broken
	e 				      b
and time's forever frozen, still

[chorus]
           e 
so you can keep me inside the pocket of your 
a
ripped jeans holding me closer 'til our 
bm                             g
eyes meet, you won't ever be alone

[bridge]
             e
and if you hurt me that's okay, baby, only 
b
words bleed inside these pages you just 
c#m                               a
hold me, and i won't ever let you go

[interlude]
                     c#m
wait for me to come home
                     a
wait for me to come home
                     e
wait for me to come home
                     b
wait for me to come home

[outro]
            e
oh, you can fit me, inside the necklace you got when you were 
b
sixteen next to your heartbeat where I
c#m                                   a 
should be, keep it deep within your soul
                  e
and if you hurt me that's okay, baby only
b
words bleed inside these pages you just 
c#m                              a
hold me and i won't ever let you go
         e
when i'm away, i will remember how you
b                                     c#m 
kissed me under the lamppost back on sixth street
                                 a
hearing you whisper through the phone
a n.c.
wait for me to come home
